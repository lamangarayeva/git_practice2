This is an awesome file. I added directly from GitHub.com
And now I am about to commit directly to Github.com remote repository
This is not somethng we would do normally
we are just trying simulate a sitaution where remote repository history is ahead of local repository history
in plain english remote has one additional commit that local does not have
